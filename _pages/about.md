With over 15 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in designing, implementing, and managing intricate routed networks. As a seasoned administrator proficient in Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows environments, including Active Directory, I bring a wealth of expertise to the table. Additionally, I possess 5 years of cloud computing experience, architecting solutions using AWS and Microsoft Azure. My portfolio extends to Enterprise Wireless Networking, where I've successfully designed and implemented tailored solutions for a diverse range of clients, from large corporate campuses to educational institutions, cannabis farms, governmental bodies, and beyond. I take pride in my track record of deploying guest internet hotspots, IP video surveillance systems, and innovative solar-powered solutions for remote off-grid relay sites.

From a young age, while my peers were shooting hoops, I was immersed in the world of technology, coding away. Computers have always been my passion, driving me to develop strong analytical skills and a deep understanding of network protocols and technologies. My ability to swiftly acquire new skills on the fly empowers me to troubleshoot, isolate, and resolve issues with efficiency and precision.
