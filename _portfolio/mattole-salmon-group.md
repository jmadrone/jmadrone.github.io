## About Citation Compliance Inc

As the IT Administrator and Project Coordinator for the Mattole Salmon Group, I orchestrate the organization's technological landscape, both onsite and in the cloud. At our office, I've established and maintain a robust local area network fortified with essential components like firewalls, gateways, and seamless wireless internet access. Additionally, I've implemented a reliable VoIP telephone system to streamline communication channels.

In the cloud, I've overseen a comprehensive migration strategy, transitioning our file server, website hosting, and backups to cloud-based solutions. This modernization effort not only optimizes accessibility and scalability but also aligns seamlessly with the dynamic nature of our workforce. With many employees operating remotely, the shift to a cloud-centric infrastructure has proven invaluable in facilitating productivity and collaboration across dispersed locations.

Furthermore, I've engineered a resilient backup strategy leveraging Azure Blob Storage, ensuring the integrity and availability of our critical data. Utilizing Bash scripts and Azure CLI, I meticulously manage and automate the backup process, providing peace of mind knowing that our digital assets are safeguarded against unforeseen events. Through strategic planning and meticulous execution, I've empowered the Mattole Salmon Group to thrive in the digital age while fortifying its technological resilience for the future.
