> The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is a rare breed that is believed to be descended from Old English Bulldogs that were brought to the Americas in the 18th century where they were used in the blood sports of bull baiting and bear baiting; they were later used as cattle and pig herders. For multiple generations, the breed was bred solely by the Lane family of Rebecca, Georgia. They eventually started a breed registry with a dog called Otto, the foundation dog of the family's breeding operation. The dog's name has occasionally been used as a nickname for the breed. In the early 21st century, there were an estimated 120 to 150 extant Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldogs.

Malcolm is registered with the [Alapaha Blue-Blood Bulldog Association](https://www.alapahabluebloodbulldog.org). Malcolm came from Cove Creek Alapaha's, in Arkansas. If you know and love this breed of dog, I highly recommend that you check out Cove Creek!

Alapaha Bulldog's are a wonderful breed, with protective instincts yet not aggressive by nature, they are wonderful protection dogs. They do best when treated as a member of the family, they care about and protect children, and you'll be hard pressed to ever find a better companion animal.
