Meet Malcolm, the embodiment of loyalty and love in canine form. With his friendly demeanor and gentle nature, Malcolm warmly welcomes all who cross his path, showering them with affection and joy. Yet beneath his playful exterior lies a guardian's heart, always watchful and ready to defend those he holds dear against any potential danger. Malcolm's unwavering devotion and protective instinct make him not just a beloved companion, but a trusted protector, ensuring peace of mind for his cherished family.

Born August 10, 2020, he just about three years old as of this writing. He is an [Alapaha Bulldog](#about-alapaha-bulldogs), a rare breed that I fell in love with many years ago, when the [first Malcolm](#the-first-malcolm) came into my life. He is such a loving and compassionate companion and a beloved member of our family. Super protective of his mother, my loving wife [Jade](/jade-madrone/), he loves to play in the snow, swim in the rivers, and romp around in the woods amongst the giant Redwood trees that we're so blessed to have all around us. Eager to make new friends, he is a giant teddy bear most of the time, while maintaining a vigilant state of readiness at all times ready to defend against any threat that presents itself, ready to give his own life if necessary.

Malcolm is registered with the [Alapaha Blue-Blood Bulldog Association](https://www.alapahabluebloodbulldog.org). Malcolm came from [Cove Creek Alapaha's](https://www.covecreekalapahas.com), in Arkansas. If you know and love this breed of dog, I highly recommend that you check out Cove Creek!

> General Appearance: The Alapaha Blue-Blood Bulldog is well put together, an athletic power-packed medium size dog (with the absence of excessive bulk). Light on its feet, it should move with power and determination; giving the impression of great strength for its size. The Alapaha is graceful and keenly alive to its surroundings. It is bold and fearless without being hostile or overly aggressive. It should be stocky, not long-legged or racy in outline. The first impression one should get is that of an athletic bulldog, not one of a high belly cur or a powerful terrier. Males are characteristically larger, heavier boned and more masculine than the bitches. The Alapaha is white with varying amounts of black, brown, red and occasionally the rare blue-merle (harlequin). When covered by patches it can range from the traditional pied markings of a patch over one or both eyes or ears, a patch on the base of the tail, to a large saddle patch and various other marks.

## About Alapaha Bulldogs

Alapaha Bulldog's are a wonderful breed, with protective instincts yet not aggressive by nature, they are wonderful protection dogs. They do best when treated as a member of the family, they care about and protect children, and you'll be hard pressed to ever find a better companion animal.

> The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is a rare breed that is believed to be descended from Old English Bulldogs that were brought to the Americas in the 18th century where they were used in the blood sports of bull baiting and bear baiting; they were later used as cattle and pig herders. For multiple generations, the breed was bred solely by the Lane family of Rebecca, Georgia. They eventually started a breed registry with a dog called Otto, the foundation dog of the family's breeding operation. The dog's name has occasionally been used as a nickname for the breed. In the early 21st century, there were an estimated 120 to 150 extant Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldogs.
